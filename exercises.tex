\section{Exercises}

This tutorial includes three exercises to check your understanding.
The solutions are given in \secref{sec:solutions}.

\subsection{The optimal discriminator strategy}
\label{sec:opt_d}

As described in \eqref{eq:discriminator_cost}, the goal of the discriminator is to minimize
\begin{equation}
  J^{(D)}(\vtheta^{(D)}, \vtheta^{(G)}) = -\frac{1}{2} \E_{\vx \sim \pdata} \log D(\vx; \vtheta^{(D)}) - \frac{1}{2} \E_{\vz} \log \left(1 - D\left( G(z); \vtheta^{(G)} \right) \right).
\end{equation}
with respect to $\vtheta^{(D)}$.
Imagine that the discriminator can be optimized in function space, so the value of
$D(\vx)$ is specified independently for every value of $\vx$.
What is the optimal strategy for $D$?
What assumptions need to be made to obtain this result?
