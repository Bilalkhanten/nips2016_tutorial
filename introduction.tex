\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This report summarizes the content of the NIPS 2016 tutorial on {\em generative adversarial networks}
(GANs) \citep{Goodfellow-et-al-NIPS2014-small}.
The tutorial was designed primarily to ensure that it answered most of
the questions asked by audience members ahead of time, in order to make sure
that the tutorial would be as useful as possible to the audience.
This tutorial is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the field
of GANs; many excellent papers are not described here, simply because
they were not relevant to answering the most frequent questions, and because
the tutorial was delivered as a two hour oral presentation and did not
have unlimited time cover all subjects.

The tutorial describes:
(1) Why generative modeling is a topic worth studying,
(2) how generative models work, and how GANs compare to other generative models,
(3) the details of how GANs work,
(4) research frontiers in GANs, and
(5) state-of-the-art image models that combine GANs with other methods.
Finally, the tutorial contains three exercises for readers to complete,
and the solutions to these exercises.
